# PAULI-Neo - The next version of PAULI-AID.

### Using the project for your own needs.
This project was created by students and as such it is **not recommended** to use it for your projects.

#### Step 1: **Install the source code.**

- After installing, unzip the zip file to any location of your liking. For example: `C:\Documents\`.

#### Step 2: **Installing Dependencies.**
- After unzipping the file, open your desired code editor and open it to the folder where you unzipped the file.
- Open a new terminal.
  - If you Visual Studio Code (VSC), this can be done by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + ~` on Windows or `Cmd + ~` on Mac devices.
  - Run `npm install`.
    - This downloads all required dependencies for the project, as stated in `package-lock.json`.
    - **Ensure you have `npm` installed.** You can check by running the command `npm -v` and it will tell you the version. Example: `10.9.2`.
    - If running the command `npm -v` doesn't do anything, you do not have `npm` installed. You can install it by running the command `npm install`.
